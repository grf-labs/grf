\title{Calculate which features the forest split on at each depth.}
\usage{
split_frequencies(forest, max.depth = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{forest}{The trained forest.}

\item{max.depth}{Maximum depth of splits to consider.}
}
\value{
A matrix of split depth by feature index, where each value
is the number of times the feature was split on at that depth.
}
\description{
Calculate which features the forest split on at each depth.

# Train a quantile forest.

p <- 10
X <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p)
Y <- X[, 1] * rnorm(n)
