\title{Predict with a multi action causal forest}
\usage{
\method{predict}{multi_arm_causal_forest}(
  object,
  newdata = NULL,
  num.threads = NULL,
  estimate.variance = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The trained forest.}

\item{newdata}{Points at which predictions should be made. If NULL, makes out-of-bag
predictions on the training set instead (i.e., provides predictions at
Xi using only trees that did not use the i-th training example). Note
that this matrix should have the number of columns as the training
matrix, and that the columns must appear in the same order.}

\item{num.threads}{Number of threads used in training. If set to NULL, the software
automatically selects an appropriate amount.}

\item{estimate.variance}{Whether variance estimates for hat{tau}(x) are desired
(for confidence intervals).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently ignored).}
}
\value{
A list with elements `predictions`: a matrix with K-1 columns with predictions for each contrast,
 and optionally `variance.estimates`: a matrix with K-1 columns with variance estimates for each contrast.
}
\description{
Gets estimates of contrasts tau_k(x) using a trained multi action causal forest.

mc.forest <- multi_arm_causal_forest(X, Y, W)

# Predict contrasts (out-of-bag) using the forest.
# By default, the first ordinal treatment is used as baseline ("A" in this example),
# giving two contrasts tau_B = Y(B) - Y(A), tau_C = Y(C) - Y(A)

# The conditional response surfaces mu_k(X) can be reconstructed from the
# contrasts tau_k(x), the treatment propensities e_k(x), and the conditional mean m(x).
# Given treatment "A" as baseline we have:
# m(x) := E[Y | X] = E[Y(A) | X] + E[W_B (Y(B) - Y(A))] + E[W_C (Y(C) - Y(A))]
# which given unconfoundedness is equal to:
# m(x) = mu(A, x) + e_B(x) tau_B(X) + e_C(x) tau_C(x)
# Rearraning and plugging in the above expressions, we obtain the following estimates
# * mu(A, x) = m(x) - e_B(x) tau_B(x) - e_C(x) tau_C(x)
# * mu(B, x) = m(x) + (1 - e_B(x)) tau_B(x) - e_C(x) tau_C(x)
# * mu(C, x) = m(x) - e_B(x) tau_B(x) + (1 - e_C(x)) tau_C(x)
