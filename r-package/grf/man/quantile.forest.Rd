\usage{
\method{quantile}{forest}(X, Y, quantiles = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9),
  sample.fraction = 0.5, mtry = ceiling(ncol(X)/3), num.trees = 2000,
  num.threads = NULL, min.node.size = NULL, keep.inbag = FALSE,
  seed = NULL, ci.group.size = 2, honesty = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The covariates used in the quantile regression.}

\item{Y}{The outcome.}

\item{quantiles}{Vector of quantiles used to calibrate the forest.}

\item{sample.fraction}{Fraction of the data used to build each tree.
Note: If honesty is used, these subsamples will
further be cut in half.}

\item{mtry}{Number of variables tried for each split.}

\item{num.trees}{Number of trees grown in the forest. Note: Getting accurate
confidence intervals generally requires more trees than
getting accurate predictions.}

\item{num.threads}{Number of threads used in training. If set to NULL, the software
automatically selects an appropriate amount.}

\item{min.node.size}{Minimum number of observations in each tree leaf.}

\item{keep.inbag}{Currently not used.}

\item{seed}{The seed of the c++ random number generator.}

\item{ci.group.size}{The forst will grow ci.group.size trees on each subsample.
In order to provide confidence intervals, ci.group.size must
be at least 2. [Note: confidence intervals for quantile forests
are not yet implemented.]}

\item{honesty}{Should honest splitting (i.e., sub-sample splitting) be used?}
}
\value{
A trained quantile forest object.
}
\description{
Trains a regression forest that can be used to estimate
quantiles of the conditional distribution of Y given X = x.
