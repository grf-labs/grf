\title{Estimate the best linear projection of a conditional average treatment effect
using a causal forest.}
\usage{
best_linear_projection(
  forest,
  A = NULL,
  subset = NULL,
  debiasing.weights = NULL,
  num.trees.for.weights = 500
)
}
\arguments{
\item{forest}{The trained forest.}

\item{A}{The covariates we want to project the CATE onto.}

\item{subset}{Specifies subset of the training examples over which we
estimate the ATE. WARNING: For valid statistical performance,
the subset should be defined only using features Xi, not using
the treatment Wi or the outcome Yi.}

\item{debiasing.weights}{A vector of length n (or the subset length) of debiasing weights.
If NULL (default) these are obtained via the appropriate doubly robust score
construction, e.g., in the case of causal_forests with a binary treatment, they
are obtained via inverse-propensity weighting.}

\item{num.trees.for.weights}{In some cases (e.g., with causal forests with a continuous
treatment), we need to train auxiliary forests to learn debiasing weights.
This is the number of trees used for this task. Note: this argument is only
used when debiasing.weights = NULL.}
}
\value{
An estimate of the best linear projection, along with coefficient standard errors.
}
\description{
Let tau(Xi) = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | X = Xi] be the CATE, and Ai be a vector of user-provided
covariates. This function provides a (doubly robust) fit to the linear model tau(Xi) ~ beta_0 + Ai * beta.
}
\details{
Procedurally, we do so by regressing doubly robust scores derived from the causal
forest against the Ai. Note the covariates Ai may consist of a subset of the Xi,
or they may be distinct The case of the null model tau(Xi) ~ beta_0 is equivalent
to fitting an average treatment effect via AIPW.

In the event the treatment is continuous the inverse-propensity weight component of the
double robust scores are replaced with a component based on a forest based
estimate of Var[Wi | Xi = x]. These weights can also be passed manually by specifying
debiasing.weights.
