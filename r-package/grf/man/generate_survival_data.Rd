  p,
  Y.max = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{n}{The number of samples.}

\item{p}{The number of covariates.}

\item{Y.max}{The maximum follow-up time (optional).}

\item{X}{The covariates (optional).}

\item{n.mc}{The number of monte carlo draws to estimate the treatment effect with. Default is 10000.}

\item{dgp}{The type of DGP.}
}
\value{
A list with entries:
 `X`: the covariates, `Y`: the event times, `W`: the treatment indicator, `D`: the censoring indicator,
 `cate`: the treatment effect estimated by monte carlo, `cate.sign`: the true sign of the cate for ITR comparison,
 `dgp`: the dgp name, `Y.max`: the maximum follow-up time.
}
\description{
The following DGPs are available for benchmarking purposes, T is the failure time
and C the censoring time:
\itemize{
  \item "simple1": T = X1*eps + W, C ~ U(0, 2) where eps ~ Exp(1) and Y.max = 1.
  \item  "type1": T is drawn from an accelerated failure time model and C from a Cox model (scenario 1 in https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09887)
  \item  "type2": T is drawn from a proportional hazard model and C from a accelerated failure time (scenario 2 in https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09887)
  \item  "type3": T and C are drawn from a Poisson distribution  (scenario 3 in https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09887)
  \item  "type4": T and C are drawn from a Poisson distribution  (scenario 4 in https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09887)
  \item  "type5": is similar to "type2" but with censoring generated from an accelerated failure time model.
