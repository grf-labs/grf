Description: Forest-based statistical estimation and inference.
  GRF provides non-parametric methods for heterogeneous treatment effects estimation
  (optionally using right-censored outcomes, multiple treatment arms or outcomes, or instrumental variables),
  as well as least-squares regression, quantile regression, and survival regression,
  all with support for missing covariates.
