Description: A pluggable package for forest-based statistical estimation and inference.
    GRF currently provides methods for non-parametric least-squares regression,
    quantile regression, and treatment effect estimation (optionally using instrumental
    variables). This package is currently in beta, and we expect to make continual
    improvements to its performance and usability.
