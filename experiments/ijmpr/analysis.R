# *** Policy evaluation with Qini curves ****

# denominate what we spend by assigning a unit a treatment. In this application
# we can simply treat the number of units we are considering deploying as the cost.

# Form a doubly robust estimate of a CATE-based Qini curve (using eval.forest).

# Form a baseline Qini curve that assigns treatment uniformly.

                    num.units,

                    R = 200,

# *** Describing the fit CATE function ****

# Our `cate.forest` has given us some estimated function \tau(x).
# Let's have a closer look at how this function stratifies our sample in terms of "covariate" profiles.
# One way to do so is to look at histograms of our covariates by for example low / high CATE predictions.

# First, we'll use a simple heuristic to narrow down the number of predictors to look closer at.
# Here we use the variable importance metric of the fit CATE function to select 4 predictors to look closer at.
