- For Figure 2, see the folder `quantile_examples`
- For Figure 3, see the file `grow_forest_angrist_evans.R`
- For Figure 5, see the folder `instrumental_examples`
- For Table 1, these are simulations using a `causal_forest` with the DGPs _aw1_ and _aw2_ from `benchmarking/dgps.R` (parent folder)
- For Table 2, see the folder `instrumental_stress_test`
- For Table 3, see the folder `instrumental_ci_test`
