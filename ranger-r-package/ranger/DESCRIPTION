Description: A fast implementation of Random Forests, particularly suited for high dimensional data. Ensembles of
             classification, regression, survival and probability prediction trees are supported. Data from genome-wide
             association studies can be analyzed efficiently. In addition to data frames, datasets of class 'gwaa.data'
             (R package GenABEL) can be directly analyzed.
