Description: A fast implementation of Random Forests, particularly suited for high dimensional data. Ensembles of
            classification, regression, survival and probability prediction trees are supported. Data from
            genome-wide association studies can be analyzed efficiently. In addition to data frames, datasets of
            class 'gwaa.data' (R package 'GenABEL') can be directly analyzed.
