This code is modified from the original StoGO Global Optimization library
by Madsen et al., downloaded from:

	http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/~km/GlobOpt/opt.html

It was modified to allow C-callable wrappers and some other niceties by
Steven G. Johnson (stevenj@alum.mit.edu) in 2007.

StoGO uses a gradient-based direct-search branch-and-bound algorithm,
