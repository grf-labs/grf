The MIT licence is ok with me, and so is your copyright suggestion.

Thanks so much for your response!

To be open source it needs some specific open-source license to specify
the permissions in legal terms.  The simplest open-source license is
probably the MIT license, is this okay?

        http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php

Also, I need to know who the authors are for the copyright statement. 
Should I list it as:
        Copyright (c) 1998 by S. Zertchaninov and K. Madsen ?

Thanks again!  I will definitely cite it if I publish any results based
on StoGO!  (It's one of the few public global-optimization programs that
is able to exploit gradient information.)

Steven G. Johnson
